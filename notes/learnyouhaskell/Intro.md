#Introduction

* Haskell is a funcitonal lanugage
* Don't tell the computer what to do, you tell it *what stuff is*
* *Referential Transparency* = guaranteed to return same thing if called in the same way
* Statically Typed - when you compile your program, compiler knows which piece of code is which
* Uses *type interface*
